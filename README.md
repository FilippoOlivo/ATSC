# Goals

## 1. Knowledge and understanding
Students will acquire advanced understanding on Computational modelling techniques, both theoretical and practical. 
Students will acquire a comprehensive understanding of scientific computing and in particular the implementation of finite element analysis concepts, specifically in C++, and with the use of modern simulation platforms. They will become familiar with object-oriented and generic programming paradigms, as well as proficient in utilising common data structures, algorithms, and relevant libraries and frameworks for scientific computing.

## 2. Applying knowledge and understanding
Students will be adept at applying their advanced programming knowledge to solve both familiar and novel coding challenges. They will be able to develop advanced programs in C++, choosing and designing appropriate data structures and algorithms to address complex real-world computational problems. They will gain the ability to construct simulation tools using modern finite element libraries. 

## 3. Making judgment
Students will develop critical thinking and analytical skills, enabling them to assess the effectiveness, flexibility, and efficiency of code implementations. They will be capable of evaluating different approaches to problem-solving and selecting optimal solutions based on informed analysis. By the end of the course, students will have developed the ability to design, implement, test, debug, and optimize complex scientific computing libraries.

## 4. Communication skills
Through a combination of in class discussions, project writing, and presentations, students will learn to effectively communicate their design decisions, code rationale, and problem-solving strategies. They will be skilled at conveying technical information.

## 5. Learning skills
Students will acquire self-directed learning abilities, enabling them to stay current with state-of-the-art numerical simulation methods and new programming languages, tools, and technologies. They will be equipped to independently identify and troubleshoot coding issues and propose innovative solutions. They will also gain experience in team-based software development practices by working on group programming projects.

# Teaching methods

The course will utilize a combination of frontal lectures and live programming demonstrations.

During the hands-on sessions, students will have the opportunity to work on problems related to the material covered in the frontal lectures. The solutions to these problems might be discussed, allowing students to receive feedback and gain a deeper understanding of the material.

The course will maintain a balance of approximately 50% frontal lectures and 50% hands-on sessions.

The course is designed to be highly interactive, with ample opportunities for students to ask questions and engage in discussions during both the frontal lectures and hands-on sessions.

---

# Verification of learning

Students will be required to complete a modelling and coding project. Their project will have to be presented to the instructor and will be discussed and evaluated during an oral exam.

The maximum achievable grade is 30. Honors may be granted in exceptional cases, provided the final grade exceeds 30.

Overall, the evaluation process is designed to encourage students to actively engage with the material and to develop practical skills that will be useful in their future careers.

# Books and material

The instructor will provide support material and references throughout the course. In addition, there are many free online resources available to supplement the course material.

For students who prefer to read books, the following references are recommended:

1. Programming - Principles and Practice Using C++, Bjarne Stroustrup, Addison-Wesley, May 2014 
2. Learning scientific programming with Python, Christian Hill, Cambridge University Press, October 2020
3. Finite Element Methods for Navier-Stokes Equations, Vivette Giraut & Pierre-Arnaud Raviart, Springer, 1986 
4. Mathematical Aspects of Discontinuous Galerkin Methods, Daniele Antonio Di Pietro & Alexandre Ern, Springer, 2012

These books provide in-depth coverage of the course material and can serve as valuable resources for further study.

# Extra info

To participate in this course, students will be requested to bring their own laptop equipped with a working Linux or UNIX environment, whether standalone or virtualized. Students are expected to utilize either a text editor, such as Emacs, Vim, or Nano, or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as VSCode, Eclipse, or Code::Blocks, according to their preference.

To ensure that their environment is suitable for the course, students should ensure that it meets the following requirements:

The environment must have a C++ compiler installed with full support for C++17, such as GCC 10 or newer, or Clang 11 or newer.

The environment must have Python 3 installed. The presence of Jupyter is recommended, but not mandatory.

The environment must meet the minimum system requirements for running a Linux or UNIX environment with the necessary software and tools for the course.

Any recent Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu 22.04 or newer, or Debian 11 or newer, or macOS system that meets these requirements should be suitable for the course.
