# Assignment

Read the documentation of `step-35`.

This program can be extended in the following directions:
1. Adaptive mesh refinement: Using adaptive mesh refinement can lead to increased accuracy while not significantly increasing the computational time.
2. Flow past a cylinder: Compare the results by changing the geometry, i.e. by using `GridGenerator::channel_with_cylinder`.
3. Extension to 3D.
